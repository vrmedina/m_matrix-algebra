# Matlab Matrix Algebra
## Some Matlab algorithms to solve matrix related problems using methods such as Cholesky, Crout, Jacobi...

### Cholesky: find out if the given matrix symetrical and positive definite and then, find the solution
### Crout: use the direct factorization LxU to find the solution of the given matrix
### Doolitle: use the direct factorization LxU to find the solution of the given matrix
### Gauss Seidel: iterate to find the solution of the matrix using an initial approximation
### Jacobi: use iterative orthogonal transformations to find the solution of the matrix
